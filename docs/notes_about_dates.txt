Notes regarding time zones in ES and SQL Server

1. SQL Server. The date values are coming back as dates with no timezone. Assuming the timezone is the SQL Server time zone or local time zone? TBD with a quick test.
2. ElasticSearch: The date type is a special type which maps to JSON string type. It follows a specific format that can be explicitly set. All dates are UTC. Internally, a date maps to a number type long, with the added parsing stage from string to long and from long to string
- We pass Date to ElasticSearch. It converts it to long, but keeps the date format to be used when converting to and from JSON
- ES assumes all dates are in UTC. So they should be converted to UTC (if different time zone). Or we should specify the time zone.
2. Date fields values are returned to Java as Strings with the format specified in mappings.


----
Approach

1. Consider all dates in UTC for now. And keep the default format.
2. The problem is when retrieving dates from ES (in Java). Need:
   a. The expected type
   b. If Date:
	- convert from string to date object using ES XContentBuilder.defaultDatePrinter
	?? How to get/where to keep the expected type ??
